  <h3>Subtree</h3>
  <section>
    <p>
      Subtree are extensions to the main tree.
      The only requirement of a subtree is that it implements
      <code>Itree<T></code> interface

    <h4>Parent to Subtree relationship</h4>
    <p style="color: yellow">
      Need to figure-out
    <ul>
      <li>Visitors have option to descend subtree</li>
      <li>Should observers of parent tree descend subtree?
        <ul> suppose
          <li>Subtree one node NOT</li>
          <li>Subtree as atypical field (date range, postal address)</li>
          <il>toPojo will have to descend children, that code is already there</il>

        </ul>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <span style="color:yellowgreen">
      Definitely <code>getTreeContents()</code>
      would not return only the parent node to subtree.
      It will return all or none?

    <h4>Subtree to parent relationship</h4>
    <p>
      Subtree is unaware it is a subtree.
      All functions, methods, counts, logic, operate only on the subtree.
