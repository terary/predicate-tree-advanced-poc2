Running Predicate Tree with Identity Subtree Example

=== Demonstrating Object Identity with Predicate Trees ===

=== Object Identity Check ===
Checking if the parent content of the subtree is the subtree itself...
✓ PASS: The parent content is not the subtree itself. Object identity is preserved correctly.
✓ PASS: Would expect to get an empty nodeContent from parent using subtreeNodeId.
✓ PASS: Retrieved original value from subtree using subtreeNodeId.

Parent Tree Structure:
(name = 'John' AND age > 18)

Identity Tree Structure:
(objectId = '123' AND type = 'Person')

Demonstrating parsing not-tree.pojo.json:
Successfully created tree from not-tree.pojo.json!
Not Tree Structure:
(A = 'example' AND B > 10 AND C = true AND A = 'test')

Attaching Identity Tree as a subtree...
All Good
