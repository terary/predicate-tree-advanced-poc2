# Predicate Tree Subtrees - Object Identity

This example demonstrates how to use predicate trees with a focus on object identity. It builds upon the concepts introduced in the `00003-predicate-tree-subtrees` example.

## Overview

In this example, we create:

1. A parent tree (LogicExpressionTree) that contains predicates about a person (name and age)
2. A subtree (IdentityTree) that contains predicates specifically identifying an object (objectId and type)
3. A combined tree structure that merges both trees to represent a complete predicate

## Files

- `index.ts` - Entry point for the example
- `predicate-tree-subtree-identity.ts` - Main script demonstrating object identity with predicate trees
- `assets/` - Directory containing supporting files:
  - `identity-tree.pojo.json` - POJO representation of the tree structures
  - `IdentityTree.ts` - Implementation of the identity tree class
  - `subjectDictionary.ts` - Dictionary of subjects used in predicates

## Running the Example

You can run this example using:

```bash
# Using the provided shell script
./index-run.sh

# Or directly with ts-node
cd ../../  # Navigate to project root
npx ts-node example-usage/00003b-predicate-tree-subtrees-object-identity/index.ts
```

The output will be "All Good" when the example runs successfully.

## What This Example Demonstrates

- How to create specialized subtrees for specific use cases (in this case, object identity)
- How to combine trees to create more complex predicate structures
- How to work with a predicate tree POJO structure
- A practical use case for predicate trees in identity checking scenarios
