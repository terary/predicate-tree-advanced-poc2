Here's an overview of how the predicate trees are built from form JSON:

The process starts when a form JSON is loaded into the system through `FsFormModel.fromApiFormJson()`. Each form field can have logic rules that determine its visibility or behavior based on other fields' values. These logic rules are transformed into predicate trees.

Here's the general flow:

1. **Initial Form Processing**:

```typescript:src/formstack/classes/subtrees/FsFormModel.ts
static fromApiFormJson(formJson: TApiForm): FsFormModel {
    const formModel = new FsFormModel();
    // Process each field in the form
    formJson.fields.forEach((fieldJson) => {
        // Create field models and store logic rules
        formModel.addField(fieldJson);
    });
    return formModel;
}
```

2. **Logic Tree Creation**:
   When a field has logic rules, they're processed into a `FsFieldLogicModel` first:

```typescript:src/formstack/classes/subtrees/trees/FsFieldLogicModel.ts
static fromFieldJson(fieldJson: TFsFieldAnyJson): FsFieldLogicModel {
    // Convert field JSON logic into a tree structure
    const rootNode = new FsLogicBranchNode(
        fieldJson.id,
        fieldJson.logic.action,
        fieldJson.logic.conditional
    );

    // Create leaf nodes for each logic condition
    fieldJson.logic.checks.forEach(check => {
        // Add predicates as leaf nodes
        tree.appendChildNodeWithContent(
            tree.rootNodeId,
            new FsLogicLeafNode(check.field, check.condition, check.option)
        );
    });
}
```

3. **Deep Logic Tree Aggregation**:
   The system then builds a deeper tree that represents the entire chain of logic dependencies using `FsLogicTreeDeep`:

```typescript:src/formstack/classes/subtrees/trees/FsLogicTreeDeep/FsLogicTreeDeep.ts
static fromFieldLogicModel(
    fieldLogicModel: FsFieldLogicModel,
    fieldCollection: FsFormModel
): FsLogicTreeDeep {
    // Create the deep tree starting with a virtual root
    const deepTree = new FsLogicTreeDeep(
        new FsVirtualRootNode(fieldLogicModel.rootFieldId)
    );

    // Recursively build the tree, following logic dependencies
    this.appendFieldTreeNodeToLogicDeep(
        fieldLogicModel,
        fieldLogicModel.rootNodeId,
        deepTree,
        deepTree.rootNodeId,
        fieldCollection
    );
}
```

The key aspect is that these trees capture not just the immediate logic conditions for a field, but also the chain of dependencies. For example, if Field A depends on Field B, which depends on Field C, the deep logic tree will represent this entire chain. This allows the system to:

1. Detect circular dependencies
2. Evaluate complex conditional logic
3. Optimize form rendering and validation
4. Track field dependencies for proper UI updates

The predicate tree structure is particularly useful because it allows for:

- Efficient traversal of logic conditions
- Easy serialization/deserialization (via toPojo/fromPojo)
- Visitor pattern implementation for tree transformations
- Clear representation of complex logic relationships

The end result is a tree structure where:

- Root nodes represent fields with logic
- Branch nodes represent logical operators (AND/OR)
- Leaf nodes represent actual field conditions
- Special nodes handle edge cases (circular dependencies, errors)
